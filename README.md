This project uses a dataset downloaded from UCI ( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/169/dorothea) that contains data used to identify if a small molecule biologic will bind to a target receptor. 
Using supervised machine learning tools, this project aims to identify small molecules that bind to the target.
